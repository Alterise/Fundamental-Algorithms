Questions  of  finding  extremal  numbers  for  given  forbidden  graphs  or  hypergraphsare  often  called  Tur ́an-type  extremal  problems  after  Paul  Tur ́an  due  to  his  importantearly results and conjectures concerning forbidden completer-graphs [14, 15, 16].  Tur ́anproblems for uniform hypergraphs make up a large and well-known area of research incombinatorics, and the questions are often surprisingly difficult to answer.Extremal problems like this have also been considered for directed graphs and multi-graphs (with bounded multiplicity) in [2] and [3] and for the more general directed multi-hypergraphs in [4].  In [3], Brown and Harary determined the extremal numbers for sev-eral types of specific directed graphs.  In [2], Brown, Erd ̋os, and Simonovits determined ageneral asymptotic structure of extremal sequences for every possible forbidden family ofdigraphs.  These limiting structures turn out to be analogous to the familiar Tur ́an graphsfor simple 2-graphs.The model
